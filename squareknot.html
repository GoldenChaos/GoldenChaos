		    <h1 id="sk-mobile">Squareknot for iPhone</h1>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Navigation.png" alt="Navigation" />
		    <p>It starts with basic navigtion that is both beautiful and exactly what you’d expect. Discover, Following, Drafts, and Me are the main tabs of the app, and they all feature a gorgeous feed that runs at a smooth 60fps and loads guides instantly, even on slow connections.</p>

		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Search.png" alt="Search" />
		    <p>We’ve also built in powerful search and a brand-new push notification system. That’s right, no more email notifications necessary! To view your notifications in the app, tap the bell icon in the top left corner. It’ll also show a badge when you have new notifications, and you can granularly turn on and off notifications in your settings. You can also keep getting emails if you really want to.</p>

		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Covers.png" alt="Covers" />
		    <p>Guides start with gorgeous full-screen covers. And we’re adding some brand-new features. For instance, now you can like guides by tapping on the heart icon (finally!).

			We’re also introducing Shopping List, which adds up all the supplies inside the guide and makes, well, a shopping list! We talked with Postmates about this feature not too long ago, and they were insanely excited about being a part of the shopping list. Our goal is to get you everything you need to do a guide in under an hour. To access the shopping list, you just tap the shopping basket icon.

			And, since people love to skim through guides, we’ve also build a gorgeous list view. You can pop in and out of steps using 3D Touch by pressing deeply on any step, or by tapping the Step List icon in the top right corner.</p>

		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Cards.png" alt="Cards" />
		    <p>The whole guide, and all of its branches, is made up of a bunch of cards! Every step card is rendered fully in 3D, with dynamic lighting and shadows. As you tilt your phone, the shadows move around. And the screen always shows cards on the edges, so you know where there’s stuff to swipe to. We wanted to simulate the feeling of sliding playing cards across a table. There’s all kinds of card physics involved here, it’s just insanely fun to use.

			You swipe up and down to go between steps. Left and right take you to either the blue Add a Branch card (where you can instantly branch the guide from that step), or to any number of branches that other users have added. To do a branch, you toss the cover card off the top, and the first step of the branch is already waiting for you underneath.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Comments.png" alt="Comments" />
		    <p>Aside from branching, comments are our most important community feature. We’re adding photo support to comments, and giving them prime placement at the top of every step along with a beautiful new design. You can also, for the first time, like comments as well.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Branching.png" alt="Branching" />
		    <p>You can toss off the Add a Branch card to start making a branch - there’s a camera card waiting underneath that lets you get started with no delay. You can choose to capture a photo, video, or text. Squareknot also remembers what your last choice was and makes that the default for the next step, too.

			Once you’ve captured something, the card turns white and you can enter the rest of the step’s information like its title, description, and any supplies that a person might need (more on that in a bit). We also have some basic photo and video editing tools like cropping, and speed controls that let you speed up your video to 2x or 4x speed. If you import a video from your camera roll, you can also trim your video before we import it.

			If you’re looking at the screenshots closely, you’ll notice that there’s another blue Add a Branch card next to Step 2 up there. That’s because you can now make branches inside of drafts, one of our most common feature requests.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Supplies.png" alt="Supplies" />
		    <p>Because supplies are critical for the shopping list, we’ve made entering in supplies faster and easier than ever. Natural language processing lets you type in supplies using plain english. We show you a preview of what your supply will look like before you add it, with animations that show you what words, quantities, and units we put where.

			We’re also smart about tools, a special type of supply. Tools in real life can be reused from step to step, so our new supplies system knows to ask if you want to reuse a tool from a previous step. That way, the shopping list always shows the correct number of tools you’ll need to do the guide.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Publishing.png" alt="Publishing" />
		    <p>When you’re done capturing your steps, you can pull to publish to bring up a publish wizard. We’ll walk you through everything you need to do to publish the guide, from capturing your cover photo to automatically sharing the guide on your favorite social networks.

			From the start, our goal was to have the best guide maker in the world; so easy and so fast that by the time you were done snapping photos, your guide was also done. We think we’ve done that, and that when you use it you’ll agree - this thing makes guides fast.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/Editing.png" alt="Editing" />
		    <p>Our new guide editing tools are also much more versatile. You can now edit your guide at any time, even if there are branches. Just tap "Edit" anywhere on your guide to enter edit mode.

			There’s no version control or nerdy stuff; you just edit your guide, and the system automatically preserves the integrity of everyone’s branches. If you remove steps that other people are using for their branches, their branches get to keep copies of those steps. And if you ever choose to delete your guide, then any branches split off into their own guides. This works for your own guides, too.

			The step list makes complex editing really easy when you need it. You can drag to rearrange steps, or swipe to delete.</p>
		    <img class="screenshot" src="images/squareknot/mobile/iOS 9.png" alt="iOS 9" />
		    <p>Finally, Squareknot is also a great citizen on iOS, supporting the latest features in iOS 9 like 3D Touch and Spotlight search integration. Support for 3D Touch runs deep inside Squareknot’s app, and you’ll find that we’re using it in really clever ways that make doing things much easier.</p>
